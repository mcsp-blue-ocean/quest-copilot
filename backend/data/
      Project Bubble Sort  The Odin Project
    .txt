#  Project: Bubble Sort

[

##  Ruby Course

](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby)

### Introduction

Sorting algorithms are some of the earliest that you typically get exposed to
in Computer Science. It may not be immediately obvious how important they are,
but it shouldn’t be hard to think of some examples where your computer needs
to sort some massive datasets during everyday operations.

One of the simpler (but more processor-intensive) ways of sorting a group of
items in an array is **bubble sort** , where each element is compared to the
one next to it and they are swapped if the one on the left is larger than the
one on the right. This continues until the array is eventually sorted.

Check out [this video from Harvard’s CS50x on Bubble
Sort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kp-8OGwphY).

There’s also [an entry on Bubble Sort on
Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort) that’s worth taking a
look at.

### Assignment

  * Build a method `#bubble_sort` that takes an array and returns a sorted array. It must use the bubble sort methodology (using `#sort` would be pretty pointless, wouldn’t it?).

    
    
    > bubble_sort([4,3,78,2,0,2])
    => [0,2,2,3,4,78]
