##  React Course

](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/react)

### Congratulations ðŸŽ‰

Woohoo, React has been conquered! You are officially a React guru. Take a
moment to appreciate what youâ€™ve learned throughout this course and give
yourself a round of applause. With React under your tool belt, you are well-
equipped to tackle complex projects confidently.

However, your React learning (or learning in general) doesnâ€™t stop here. As
proponents of a growth mindset, we believe thereâ€™s so much more to explore and
learn.

### Whatâ€™s next

Frontend is the land of innovation, and React is one of the leaders in the
space. You can keep up with the future of React by following the [React RFC
GitHub repository](https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs). This is where new
features and changes to React are proposed, discussed, and eventually accepted
or rejected. One of the groundbreaking RFCs is [Server
Components](https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/blob/main/text/0188-server-
components.md). Over this course, weâ€™ve rendered our React components in the
client, but here this RFC discusses how we can bring React to the server and
render it there. This feature has huge potential and is worth keeping an eye
on in the future.

Furthermore, you can dive into React meta frameworks. Theyâ€™re a framework for
React that add first-class support for functionalities like data fetching and
routing. Additionally, they leverage Reactâ€™s latest features to provide the
best experience possible for developers and users alike. Some examples of
these are [Next](https://nextjs.org/) and [Remix](https://remix.run/).

Youâ€™re at a point in your React journey where you can begin learning about
design patterns and architecture. [patterns.dev](https://www.patterns.dev/) is
an exceptional resource that will help you build better React apps by
leveraging powerful patterns. They are worth a bookmark!

Before you move onto the next section. Fill out this [React course feedback
survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdj_tNMp0LEz3ZLPqYcF67V11tX_CCJP3CTictPZzZ6XQm2Gw/viewform?usp=sf_link)
to add your input and experience with the section. This helps us improve the
section as well as the overall course and is greatly appreciated.

### Using a backend

As youâ€™ve seen, you can get your apps to do a lot of pretty cool things
already, just using client-side JavaScript. You may have noticed, though, that
there is still an important piece of the puzzle missing: unless you use [Local
Storage](http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2010/10/11/local-storage-and-how-
to-use-it/), your app â€˜forgetsâ€™ the userâ€™s preferences, as well as any other
changes made, as soon as the page gets reloaded.

While Local Storage is great, itâ€™s not ideal: it only stores data on the
computer from which the user is accessing the page. This approach does not
allow for the app to â€˜rememberâ€™ anything when the same user tries to access it
again from a different device. For that, youâ€™re going to need a real backend,
which youâ€™ll learn all about next in our
[NodeJS](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-
javascript/courses/nodejs) course. With Node, weâ€™ll be able to add a bunch of
cool features to your apps like user authentication, data persistence, and
more.

### Contribute

The Odin Project wouldnâ€™t exist if not for contributors sharing their precious
time and resources. Weâ€™d love to hear your ideas and suggestions to improve
the React course. You can share your thoughts over on our Discord or better
yet, open an issue on the [The Odin Projectâ€™s curriculum
repository](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/curriculum/issues).

Good luck and happy learning!
