#  Routing

[

##  Ruby on Rails Course

](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-
on-rails)

### Introduction

The router is the doorman of your application. When an HTTP request arrives
from the user’s browser, it needs to know which controller action (method)
should be run. Should we display the “new user” webpage? Should we edit an
existing user with whatever data got sent along?

The Router is basically just a matching service. It looks at the HTTP verb
(GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and the URL that is being requested and matches it
with the appropriate controller action to run. It’s a pretty simple function
but an essential one. If it can’t find a route that matches the request, your
application will throw an error.

The other handy thing that goes on when a request enters your application is
that Rails grabs all the parameters that came with it and makes them available
for you in a special hash called `params` that you can later use in your
controller. That’s good for things like form submissions so that you later can
use that form data to create or modify objects.

If you open the routes file in your Rails app (located in `config/routes.rb`),
you’ll see a link to the Rails Guides routing section. This resource does a
good job of explaining how it works, so you’re never in much danger of losing
your way.

Lots of training courses and tutorials kind of gloss over routes, and they
seem quite easy in hindsight, but when learning Rails it’s easy to get hung up
on what exactly is going on. Luckily, typing `$ rails routes` into the command
line will give you an output of all the routes that are available to your
application. In this section we’ll go into what’s actually happening with this
file.

### Lesson overview

This section contains a general overview of topics that you will learn in this
lesson.

  * Configuring a root route.
  * Configuring RESTful routes for a resource.
  * Configuring customized routes for a resource.
  * The 7 RESTful controller actions.
  * How to obtain a list of all possible routes for your current Rails application.
  * Helper methods to create a navigation link on your webpage.

### Root

The most important (and simplest) route in your file is the root URL… where
should users be deposited when they land on
`http://supercutekittenphotos.com`? Just tell Rails which controller and
action to map that route to, and it is so:

    
    
      root to: "kittens#index"  #kittens controller, index action (method)
    

Remember, when we say “action” we really mean “the method inside the
controller that is called that”, e.g. the `index` action is just the `index`
method that’s defined in the KittensController*

### RESTful routes

If you recall our earlier discussion about REST, there are basically seven
main types of actions that you can (and should) do to a “resource”, or an
object like a blog post or user… something with its own database model. From
that discussion, they are:

  1. GET all the posts (aka **“index”** the posts)
  2. GET just one specific post (aka **“show”** that post)
  3. GET the page that lets you create a new post (aka view the **“new”** post page)
  4. POST the data you just filled out for a new post back to the server so it can create that post (aka **“create”** the post)
  5. GET the page that lets you edit an existing post (aka view the **“edit”** post page)
  6. PUT the data you just filled out to edit the post back to the server so it can actually perform the update (aka **“update”** the post)
  7. DELETE one specific post by sending a delete request to the server (aka **“destroy”** the post)

The highlighted words correspond to standard Rails controller actions!

Each of these represents a “RESTful” route, and so it makes sense that you’ll
need a way to write these in your Router file so the requests they represent
are actually routed to the proper action of your controller (in this case, the
“Posts” controller). One way to write them out would be the long way:

    
    
      get "/posts", to: "posts#index"
      get "/posts/new", to: "posts#new"
      get "/posts/:id", to: "posts#show"
      post "/posts", to: "posts#create"  # usually a submitted form
      get "/posts/:id/edit", to: "posts#edit"
      put "/posts/:id", to: "posts#update" # usually a submitted form
      delete "/posts/:id", to: "posts#destroy"
    

Each of these routes is basically a Ruby method that matches that particular
URL and HTTP verb with the correct controller action. Two things to notice:

  1. The first key thing to notice is that several of those routes submit to the SAME URL… they just use different HTTP verbs, so Rails can send them to a different controller action. That trips up a lot of beginners.
  2. The other thing to notice is that the “id” field is prepended by a colon… that just tells Rails “Look for anything here and save it as the ID in the params hash”. It lets you submit a GET request for the first post and the fifth post to the same route, just a different ID:

    
    
      /posts/1  # going to the #show action of the PostsController
      /posts/5  # also going to the #show action of PostsController
    

You will be able to access that ID directly from the controller by tapping
into the params hash where it got stored.

### The Rails way to write RESTful routes

Rails knows you want to use those seven actions all the time… so they came up
with a handy helper method which lets you do in one line what we just wrote in
seven lines in our resources file:

    
    
      # in config/routes.rb
      ...
      resources :posts
      ...
    

That’s it. That is a Ruby method which basically just outputs those seven
routes we talked about before. No magic. You see it a whole lot, now you know
what it does.

### Rails routes and route helpers

With that above line in our routes file, what do our routes look like? If you
type `$ rails routes` on the command line, it’ll output all the routes your
application knows, which look like:

    
    
      edit_post  GET  /posts/:id/edit(.:format)  posts#edit
    

You can see the incoming HTTP verb and URL in the middle columns, then the
controller action they map to on the right, which should all be quite familiar
because you just wrote it in the routes file. The `(.:format)` just means that
it’s okay but not required to specify a file extension like `.doc` at the end
of the route… it will just get saved in the `params` hash for later anyway.
But what’s on the leftmost column? That’s the “name” of the route.

There are a lot of situations where you want to be able to retrieve the URL
for a particular route, like when you want to show navigation links on your
webpage (do NOT hard code the URLS, because you’ll be out of luck when you
decide to change the URLs and have to manually go in and change them
yourself). Rails gives you a helper method that lets you create links called
`link_to`, but you’ll need to supply it with the text that you want to show
and the URL to link it to.

    
    
      link_to "Edit this post", edit_post_path(3) # don't hardcode 3!
    

We’re jumping a little bit ahead, but in this case, the second argument is
supposed to be a path or a URL, so we use the path helper method to generate
that. `edit_post_path(3)` will generate the path `/posts/3/edit`.

Rails automatically generates helper methods for you which correspond to the
names of all your routes. These methods end with `_path` and `_url`. `path`,
as in `edit_post_path(3)`, will generate just the path portion of the URL,
which is sufficient for most applications. `url` will generate the full URL.

Any routes which require you to specify an ID or other parameters will need
you to supply those to the helper methods as well (like we did above for
edit). You can also put in a query string by adding an additional parameter:

    
    
      post_path(3, :referral_link => "/some/path/or/something")
    

Now the `:referral_link` parameter would be available in your `params` hash in
your controller in addition to the normal set of parameters.

### Routes go to controller actions!

Just to drive home that routes correspond directly to controller actions, a
very simple sample controller which would fulfill the above routes generated
by `resources :posts` might look like:

    
    
      # in app/controllers/posts_controller.rb
      class PostsController < ApplicationController
    
        def index
          # very simple code to grab all posts so they can be
          # displayed in the Index view (index.html.erb)
        end
    
        def show
          # very simple code to grab the proper Post so it can be
          # displayed in the Show view (show.html.erb)
        end
    
        def new
          # very simple code to create an empty post and send the user
          # to the New view for it (new.html.erb), which will have a
          # form for creating the post
        end
    
        def create
          # code to create a new post based on the parameters that
          # were submitted with the form (and are now available in the
          # params hash)
        end
    
        def edit
          # very simple code to find the post we want and send the
          # user to the Edit view for it (edit.html.erb), which has a
          # form for editing the post
        end
    
        def update
          # code to figure out which post we're trying to update, then
          # actually update the attributes of that post. Once that's
          # done, redirect us to somewhere like the Show page for that
          # post
        end
    
        def destroy
          # very simple code to find the post we're referring to and
          # destroy it.  Once that's done, redirect us to somewhere fun.
        end
      end
    

Remember that you can run `$ rails routes` in the project directory to see all
of the routes with their corresponding controllers and actions.

### We don’t want all seven routes!

Sometimes you just don’t want all seven of the RESTful routes that `resources`
provides. Easy, either specify just the ones you want using `only` or just the
ones you DON’T want using `except`:

    
    
      resources :posts, only: [:index, :show]
      resources :users, except: [:index]
    

### Non-RESTful routes

Of course, you don’t have to do everything the RESTful way. You probably
should, but there are times that you want to make up your own route and map it
to your own controller action. Just follow the examples we gave at the top for
RESTful routes:

    
    
      get '/somepath', to: 'somecontroller#someaction'
    

… of course, the `config/routes.rb` comments should be helpful to you here as
well.

### Assignment

You should have a good sense of what’s going on in the routes file by now but
probably also have plenty of questions. The Rails Guides to the rescue!

  1. Read the [Rails Guides chapter on Routing](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html), sections 1-2.5, 3.1-3.4, 4.6, and 6.1
  2. Watch this [Wonderful explanation of how REST and HTTP works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-BpqyOT3a8). You can follow the tutorial using `curl https://api.github.com`.
