### Introduction

HTML Tables allow you to create two-dimensional tables made of rows and
columns. In this lesson, you will learn everything you need to know about HTML
Tables.

### Learning outcomes

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to do the following:

  * Create advanced HTML tables.

### HTML tables

Some data just really needs to be displayed in a table. HTML tables might be
less commonly used than buttons, links, lists and everything else you’ve
learned so far, but there are some cases where they’re the _perfect_ tool.
Some of the more advanced features can get a little tricky to set up correctly
but getting started with tables is pretty easy. You create a table with
`<table></table>` tags and then put the elements for rows, columns, headers,
or anything else that’s possible inside those table elements.

For example:

See the Pen [ HTML Tables
Example](https://codepen.io/TheOdinProjectExamples/pen/JjrYEqX) by
TheOdinProject
([@TheOdinProjectExamples](https://codepen.io/TheOdinProjectExamples)) on
[CodePen](https://codepen.io).

In this codepen example we created a table element, containing two table row
elements. The first row has two headings while the second row has 2 data
cells.

### Assignment

  1. Read these [Tables Basics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Tables/Basics) and [Tables Advanced](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Tables/Advanced) tutorials from MDN. They should teach you all the syntax behind HTML tables. It’s pretty straightforward. Make sure to code along!
  2. Do this [Tables Assessment](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Tables/Structuring_planet_data) from MDN. It’s good to put your newly learned skills to practice!

### Additional resources

This section contains helpful links to related content. It isn’t required, so
consider it supplemental.

  * Pencil & Paper published a great [article about things you can achieve with tables](https://pencilandpaper.io/articles/ux-pattern-analysis-enterprise-data-tables) if you dare to spend some time giving them some love. They suggest some good habits on how you should format your data which is pretty simple and makes a huge difference. These are not a list of must dos to a table, but ideas worth keeping in mind for the next time a table is bothering you with how it looks.
