Today, we're not just talking about an application; we're talking about an awakening, a seismic shift in how we approach software development.

## Quick Understanding of Essential Software Technologies (QUEST)

QUEST is a comprehensive resource for all software engineers. It's a conversational assistant leveraging cutting-edge AI, tailored specifically for you, the developers of tomorrow. By integrating Gemini AI with TruLens, we've crafted a system that understands your natural language queries and provides answers rooted in ethical, accurate AI reasoning.

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Second, run the development server:

```
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
